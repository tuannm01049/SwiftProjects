(CNN) -- The future of Europe may rest on whether NATO can recover its roots.
With Russian President Vladimir Putin "land grabbing" and violating international law, the alliance is finding itself "brought back to its core," says Jaap de Hoop Scheffer, NATO's former secretary general. But it isn't prepared.
When NATO was founded in 1949, its central task was to protect its members against military aggression and work to promote democracy -- which, in the years following, often meant standing against the Soviet empire.
The alliance declares success in achieving that goal peacefully, saying on its website that "throughout the entire period of the Cold War, NATO forces were not involved in a single military engagement." But things changed after the Cold War. The focus was no longer on Russia. NATO says "new threats" emerged. The alliance got involved militarily in Bosnia and Herzegovina in the 1990s, and later in Macedonia. It established a military force in Afghanistan, and has forces in Somalia and some other parts of Africa.
Now, Russia is increasing its reach, and getting close to NATO terrain. It annexed Ukraine's Crimean Peninsula in March and is accused of sending its troops into eastern Ukraine in support of pro-Russian rebels, a claim that Moscow denies. So, 55 years into its existence, NATO finds itself, as the Financial Times put it, going "back to the future."
The two leaders also called for a "multinational rapid response force, composed of land, air, maritime and special forces, that could deploy anywhere in the world at very short notice." In addition, they urged all NATO nations to meet the 2% target for defense spending.
But some countries, including Germany, are resistant to do so -- "not only because of the weak European economy but also not to aggravate the crisis with Russia over Ukraine any further," the Soufan Group, which tracks security threats, said in a briefing Thursday.
Still, Ukraine has sought NATO help in the crisis. And while the country is not a member of the alliance, "its new leaders seek eventual membership" -- a move that angers Putin, the briefing noted.
